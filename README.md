**Introduction**

Spigot 1.17.1 plugin adding some military stuff (ballistic missiles, basic artillery, weapons, mines) to the game. As it was initially developped for playing some mini-(not so mini)-games with friends, the code is not commented nor structured in a way that would allow to use it as an API or to be easily understandable for someone else. However, I tried to write it in a way which would facilitate maintenance. I decided to make it public to let other people enjoy with this plugin, improve it and make suggestions.

If you use (parts of) the code here, don't hesitate to cite this repository somewhere visible and to let me know what you did with it, whether it be for having fun with some friends or for a server !

**TODO List**
1. Fix known bugs
2. In BigGameCommand : asking permission to Game handler if can place base
6. REPAIR : Adding custom projectile protection to the armors
7. REPAIR : Adding a perforing shell
8. (To be tested) Limiting spectating of death siege attackers to view of teammates
10. (For the long term) Adding a Wiki and more to the GitHub
11. (For the long term) Adding mortars ?

**Known Bugs**
